## Intro

Protodate is a very fast and lightweight solution for building, parsing, manipulating and formatting Javascript Dates. Protodate extends the native JS Date object for ease of use and to keep the library light. By leveraging native, low-level code Protodate is able to achieve unprecedented speeds. 

Compare Protodate to Moment.js:

| Protodate | Moment.js |
| --- | --- |
| Parses Dates more than **2x faster** | Slower |
| Calculates elapsed time nearly **20x faster** | Much slower |
| Minified @ 9.5kb (**5x Lighter**) | Minified @ 50.43kb |
| [**100% code coverage**](https://coveralls.io/github/Pamblam/protodate) | [only 94.6% code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/moment/moment) |

[Check out the benchmarks](https://jsperf.com/protodate-v-moment-js/1).

Also, if you happened to be a PHP developer, you're in luck because Protodate uses the same [date formatting](#formatting-characters) as PHP's native `date` function.


## Usage

#### Browsers:

Download and include the [protodate.js](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/blob/master/protodate.js) file or the minified, production-ready [protodate.min.js](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/blob/master/protodate.min.js) and include it in your markup.

    <script src='protodate.min.js'></script>
    
#### Node

Install it with `npm install protodate` and require it in your script.

    const Date = require('protodate.js');

## Formatting Dates

Use the [`format(formatStr)`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#new-dateformatformatstr) method to format dates as strings. Use the [Formatting Characters Table](#formatting-characters) to build your format string.

**Example**: `new Date().format("m/d/y g:i a")`

## Parsing Dates

Use the [`parse(dateStr[, formatStr])`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#dateparsedatestr-formatstr) method to create a Date object from a string. If you provide a format string to the method, parsing will be much faster, but protodate is smart enough to guess just about any format without it. Use any of the parsable formatting characters to create a [format string](#formatting-characters).

**Example**: `Date.parse("January 3rd 2007 @ 4 o'clock")`

## Manipulating Dates

Use the [`plus(quantity, period)`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#new-dateplusquantity-period) and [`minus(quantity, period)`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#new-dateminusquantity-period) methods to add and subtract time from a Date instance.

The `period` parameter is the unit of time to add or subtract, and the quantity parameter is how many of them to add or subtract. Specify the period parameter with using one of the 6 [Date Period Constants](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#constants), (ie, [`Date.MILLISECOND`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#datemillisecond), [`Date.SECOND`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#datesecond), [`Date.MINUTE`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#dateminute), [`Date.HOUR`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#datehour), [`Date.DAY`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#dateday), [`Date.YEAR`](https://github.com/Pamblam/protodate/wiki#dateyear)).

**Example**: `new Date().add(3, Date.DAY) // 3 days from now`

## Formatting Characters

Each character represents part of a date format string. Characters listed as *Parsable* are understood by the `parse` method. All other characters, as well as characters escaped with a `\` in the format string will be printed as-is.

| format character  | Description | Example returned values | Parsable |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Day**  | **--**  | **--** | **--** |
